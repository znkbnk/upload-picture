Remember to break down each step into
smaller tasks and test your code frequently.
This project will help you understand how
to handle file uploads in a React application
and give you hands-on experience working with
React components and state management.

Step 1: Set up the project

-  Create a new React project using
Create React App or your preferred setup.
-  Open your project in a code editor.

Step 2: Create the file uploader component

-  Create a new file called FileUploader.js
in your components directory.
-  Define a functional component called FileUploader.
-  Set up the component's state using the
useState hook to store the selected file.
-  Create an onChange event handler that captures
the selected file and updates the component's state.
-  Render an input element of type file and attach
the onChange event handler to it.
-  Add any necessary styling and display the 
selected file's name (optional).

Step 3: Implement file upload functionality

-  Install a package for handling file uploads,
such as axios or fetch.
-  Import the package into your FileUploader component.
-  Create a function called uploadFile that sends
the selected file to the server.
-  Use the package you installed to send a
POST request to the server with the file data.
-  Handle the server's response, such as 
displaying a success message or handling errors.

Step 4: Add form validation (optional)

-  Implement basic validation to ensure the
selected file meets your requirements (e.g., file type, size).
-  Display an error message if the selected file is invalid.
-  Disable the upload button if the selected file is invalid.

Step 5: Use the FileUploader component in your app

-  Open the component where you want to use the FileUploader.
-  Import the FileUploader component.
-  Add the FileUploader component to your JSX
and pass any necessary props.
-  Handle the uploaded file in your app, such as
displaying it or performing further actions.

Step 6: Test your file uploader

-  Start your React development server.
-  Open your app in a web browser and test the
file upload functionality.
-  Select a file and verify that it uploads successfully.
-  Test with different file types and sizes to
ensure your validation works as expected.
-  Check the server's response and error handling.

Step 7: Enhance the user experience (optional)

-  Add a progress bar or spinner to indicate
the file upload progress.
-  Implement drag and drop functionality to allow 
users to drag files onto the upload area.
-  Preview the selected file before uploading.
-  Allow users to select and upload multiple files at once.
-  Add additional features or customization
based on your project's requirements.

Note: This code assumes that you have a server
endpoint at /upload that handles the file upload.
Adjust the endpoint URL and handle the server-side
logic as per your specific backend setup.
